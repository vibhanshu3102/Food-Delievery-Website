            <h2> Food ordering</h2>
            <p>The online ordering system also enables customers to order days beforehand and the system will execute
                the order at the specified time. The system has been built to handle large amounts of traffic
                simultaneously to prevent a system overload.

                This system is also flexible in a way, whereby customers are able to place online orders quickly, with
                just a ‘click’ comparing to the tradition where orders were taken through the phone. More time and cost
                will be saved ordering online as a phone bill is charged according to the time the phone is on the line.
                The system was used intended to meet the requirements of all of the clients.</p>

            <h2> New Cuisines</h2>
            <p>Quality and value of food is an important factor in retention of loyal and creation of customers in a
                restaurant especially when targeting tourists.

                Preparation of food of good quality means use of ingredients of good quality thus food production by
                farmers affects directly the quality and value of food. Customers have to get the value for money they
                are spending on producing food and this is only achieved if the farming materials used are of high
                quality.</p>

            <h2> Fast Delievery</h2>
            <p>Express delivery is the fastest form of shipping. The customer pays an extra shipping cost for this type
                of delivery, as the shipment will get transported to him anywhere between 30 minutes. Delivery by
                express is the fastest delivery method. Ready for the future of logistics?.
                online food ordering system or an online ordering platform is a place where customers can directly order
                from the restaurant instead of going through a third-party food delivery business. It is a web-based
                ordering system where customers using a mobile app can use the online user interface to order online.
